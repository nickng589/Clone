Solve puzzles and meet new friends while exploring a magical forest world!

While searching for a lost friend, Pero is split between dimensions and must control both versions of himself to exit the forest. Will you focus on the search or solve the mystery of the forest?  Along the way, you'll solve challenging puzzles and meet new characters who will guide you along.
